# AI Behaviors

Consistent patterns for AI interaction with the developer.

## Silent Application

- Apply rules silently unless clarification is truly necessary
- Surface concerns only when patterns conflict or trade-offs are significant

## When to Push Back

- If approaches are relatively equal in quality: Don't push back
- If one approach is significantly better: Surface the trade-offs clearly
- Once the developer acknowledges the trade-offs: Defer—don't push further
- Goal is informed decision-making, not winning arguments

## Documentation Consultation

- Navigate directly to official documentation URLs specified in rules
- Do not rely on generic searches when official docs are available
- When docs are unclear or unavailable: Ask user for guidance
- For topics not covered by provided documentation: Web search is acceptable, but inform user that results are from web search, not official docs

## Existing Projects

- Analyze codebase to determine established patterns before suggesting changes
- Work with established patterns unless user requests migration
- Flag inconsistencies to user rather than silently mixing approaches
