# SEO Best Practices

Universal SEO guidelines for AI-parsable, search-optimized web content.

## When to Apply

- Content/copy changes on public pages
- Meta tags, Open Graph, or page titles
- JSON-LD structured data
- Sitemap or robots.txt changes
- Location/service area pages

## When NOT to Apply

- Admin dashboards, auth pages, internal tools
- Pages with `noindex` directive
- Non-public routes (API, webhooks)
- Backend-only code

## AI Search Optimization (LLM Parsability)

Modern search includes AI assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) that recommend services and answer questions by quoting web content.

- First 100 words should answer: who, what, where, why
- FAQ answers must be self-contained and directly quotable
- Use natural language people actually search
- Include location context naturally when relevant
- Avoid jargon; prefer terms users would type or speak

## Structured Data (Schema.org)

### Guidelines

- Use JSON-LD format (Google's preference)
- Validate with [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- Use consistent `@id` URIs for entity linking across schemas
- Don't add multiple `@type` unless genuinely needed
- Avoid duplicate schema blocks; keep one primary entity per page
- Only add schemas when content genuinely matches—no fake FAQs or reviews

### Common Schemas

| Schema | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `Organization` / `LocalBusiness` | Business identity, contact info |
| `FAQPage` | Only when genuine FAQ content exists |
| `Service` / `Product` | Offerings with real descriptions |
| `BreadcrumbList` | Navigation context |
| `Review` / `AggregateRating` | Real reviews only |

### Optional/Niche

- `speakable` — voice search optimization; limited support, treat as experimental
- `hreflang` — multi-locale sites only

### Example

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "@id": "https://example.com/#business",
  "name": "Business Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "areaServed": [{ "@type": "City", "name": "City Name" }]
}
```

## Meta Tags

| Tag | Guidance |
|-----|----------|
| Title | ~50-60 chars, primary keyword early |
| Description | ~150-160 chars, include CTA |
| Canonical | Absolute URL, required on indexable pages only |
| Robots | Explicit `index,follow` or `noindex,nofollow` when needed; frameworks may set sensible defaults |
| Open Graph | `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` (1200x630, branded), `og:type`, `og:url` |
| Language | `lang` attribute on `<html>` |

Character counts are guidelines, not hard limits—prioritize clarity and intent.

## URL Structure

- Use lowercase, kebab-case (e.g., `/service-name` not `/Service_Name`)
- Keep URLs short and descriptive; include primary keyword
- Avoid deep nesting (>3 levels) where possible
- Enforce trailing slash consistency (pick one style, stick to it)
- Avoid query parameters for content variation; use clean paths

## Content Hierarchy

- One H1 per page containing primary keyword
- Avoid multiple H1s from shared layouts or components
- H2s for major sections (secondary keywords)
- H3s for subsections
- First paragraph should answer the page's core question

## Image Optimization

- **File Naming**: Descriptive filenames (`blue-widget.jpg`, not `IMG_123.jpg`)
- **Formats**: Serve WebP/AVIF with fallbacks; avoid unoptimized PNGs for photos
- **Dimensions**: Always set explicit `width` and `height` attributes to prevent CLS
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive but concise; avoid keyword stuffing
- **Lazy Loading**: Use `loading="lazy"` for below-fold images
- **Responsive**: Provide `srcset` for multiple resolutions when practical

## Technical SEO Checklist

For public, indexable sites:

- [ ] robots.txt allows crawling (do NOT block CSS/JS—Google needs them to render)
- [ ] XML sitemap at /sitemap.xml
- [ ] Canonical URLs prevent duplicate content
- [ ] Images: alt text, explicit dimensions, optimized formats
- [ ] Internal linking between related pages
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms

## Local SEO

**Only apply when local intent exists** (location-based services, physical businesses).

Skip for SaaS, global products, or non-local services.

When applicable:

- NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone) across all pages
- Service area pages for each location served
- Google Business Profile alignment
- Location keywords in titles and content naturally
