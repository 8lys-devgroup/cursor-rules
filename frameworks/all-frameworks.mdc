# Framework Conventions

When working with any framework, follow official documentation and conventions.

## Documentation

- Navigate directly to the official documentation URL specified in the framework-specific rule
- Verify patterns against current official docs before implementing
- Do not rely on generic searches—use the provided documentation URLs
- If no framework-specific rule provides a documentation URL: Ask user for the official docs location

## Patterns

- Use official CLI commands for scaffolding and setup
- Prefer patterns shown in official examples
- Follow established project patterns unless user requests migration

## Avoid

- Custom implementations when official utilities exist
- Outdated patterns from older versions
- Patterns that conflict with the framework's conventions
