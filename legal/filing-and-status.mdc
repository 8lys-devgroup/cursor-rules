# Filing + Status + Index Rules (docs/legal)

## Canonical structure (locked)
- `docs/legal/Drafts/` contains **draft markdown** documents.
- `docs/legal/Executed/` contains **executed PDFs only** (DocuSign output). No executed markdown counterpart.
- `docs/legal/Archive/` contains superseded/withdrawn/replaced items.

## Default placement
- New documents you draft: `docs/legal/Drafts/...`
- Only place something under `docs/legal/Executed/...` when the user explicitly confirms it is executed/signed and you have the PDF.

## Executed PDF layout (locked)
Executed PDFs must be stored inside a per-document folder:
- `docs/legal/Executed/SOWs/SOW-####/SOW-#### - Statement of Work - [short-title].pdf`
- `docs/legal/Executed/Change_Orders/CO-####/CO-#### - Change Order - [short-title].pdf`
- `docs/legal/Executed/Acceptance/AC-####/AC-#### - Acceptance Certificate - SOW-#### - [deliverable-or-milestone].pdf`

## Index file (required)
`docs/legal/00-Index.md` is the authoritative index.

### When to update
Update `docs/legal/00-Index.md` whenever you create a new doc folder (SOW/CO/AC/MSA exhibit).

### Table schemas (locked)
- SOWs: `ID | Title | Status | Effective Date | Link | Supersedes`
- Change Orders: `ID | Related SOW | Summary | Status | Date | Link`
- Acceptance Certificates: `ID | Related SOW | Deliverables/Milestone | Status | Acceptance Date | Link`
- MSA/Exhibits: `Name | Status | Date | Link`

### Link target rule (locked)
- If an executed PDF exists for that ID, the **Link** must point to the PDF in `docs/legal/Executed/...`.
- Otherwise, the **Link** must point to the draft markdown file in `docs/legal/Drafts/...`.

## Plan source (locked)
When drafting a SOW/CO, the plan source must be a file under `.cursor/plans/`.
