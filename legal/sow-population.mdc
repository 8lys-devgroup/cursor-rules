# SOW Population Rules (Plan → SOW)

## Preconditions (hard stop)
- Do not draft a SOW unless you can cite a plan source under `.cursor/plans/`.
- Use auto-numbering rules in `auto-numbering.mdc`.
- Draft SOW output location is `docs/legal/drafts/sows/SOW-####/`.

## Template selection
Select exactly one:
- Fixed Bid → `docs/legal/contracts/SOW Template - Fixed Bid.md`
- Time & Materials → `docs/legal/contracts/SOW Template - Time and Materials.md`
- Maintenance & Support → `docs/legal/contracts/SOW Template - Maintenance and Support.md`

If the plan does not clearly indicate which model applies, stop and ask: fixed bid vs T&M vs maintenance.

## Required extracted plan fields (must be present or left as placeholders)
- Parties/dates: `[CLIENT LEGAL NAME]`, `[MSA DATE]`, `[DATE]` (effective date)
- Project overview: purpose/objectives/constraints
- Deliverables list `D1..Dn`: name + description
- Acceptance criteria per deliverable: testable/measurable
- In-scope / out-of-scope bullets
- Assumptions (and consequence if assumption fails)
- Fees model details (amounts/rates/retainer/NTE) and payment triggers
- Client responsibilities + deadlines
- Dependencies / third-party materials (provider, cost, responsible party)

## Draft formatting rules
- Preserve template structure and headings.
- Use placeholders in `[BRACKETS]` where unknown.
- Add `[TODO: ...]` only for items that must be resolved before execution/signature.

## Deliverables + acceptance criteria requirements
- Fixed Bid SOW: fill the Deliverables table and include **specific acceptance criteria** per deliverable (measurable).
- T&M SOW: if using the Deliverables table, keep it “anticipated outputs” unless the plan explicitly treats them as binding commitments.
- Maintenance SOW: define what counts as “minor enhancement” by setting `[X] hours` and keep excluded categories explicit.

## Tracking table (required)
At top of the SOW draft, include a Tracking table with:
- DocID (the SOW ID)
- Status: Draft
- Related IDs: (none initially)
- Date
- Summary
- Source: `.cursor/plans/...`
