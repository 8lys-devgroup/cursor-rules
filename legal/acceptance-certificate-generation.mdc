# Acceptance Certificate Generation Rules

## Preconditions
- Identify the relevant SOW (`SOW-####`) and cite it.
- Identify whether acceptance is partial (subset) or final.
- Use auto-numbering rules in `auto-numbering.mdc`.

## Template
Use: `docs/legal/contracts/Acceptance Certificate Template.md`

## Content rules (required)
- AC may be partial or final.
- The Deliverables Accepted table must list **exactly** the deliverables being accepted (name + short description).
- Must reference SOW number/title and SOW effective date.
- Do not assert “Payment Received occurred” unless user explicitly confirmed; keep template boilerplate language intact.

## Output location
- `docs/legal/Drafts/Acceptance/AC-####/AC-#### - Acceptance Certificate - SOW-#### - [deliverable-or-milestone].md`

## Tracking table (required)
At top of the AC draft, include a Tracking table with:
- DocID (AC-####)
- Status: Draft
- Related IDs: `SOW-####` (and optional COs if relevant)
- Date
- Summary
- Source: `.cursor/plans/...` if acceptance is tied to a plan; otherwise `N/A`
