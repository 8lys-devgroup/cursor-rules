# Change Order Generation Rules (and New SOW vs CO)

## Preconditions
- Use plan source under `.cursor/plans/` (required).
- Determine controlling executed SOW using the plan’s Controlling SOW selection rule.

## Decision rule: New SOW vs Change Order
If no controlling executed SOW exists → **new SOW** (do not draft a CO).

If a controlling executed SOW exists:
- Draft a **CO** when the request modifies the existing SOW’s deal terms for that same scope, including changes to:
  - deliverables/specs/acceptance criteria
  - schedule/milestones/payment triggers
  - fees/rates/retainer/NTE/authorization rules
  - material assumptions/dependencies shifting cost/risk allocation
- Draft a **new SOW** when it is a separate workstream that can be cleanly scoped without rewriting prior deliverables/acceptance/payment terms.

Tie-breakers:
- Add-on scope that can be appended without changing original deliverables → default **new SOW**.
- If you must rewrite original deliverables/acceptance/payment terms → default **CO**.

## CO triggers by SOW type
- Fixed Bid: CO required for any change to scope/deliverables/acceptance/schedule/fees.
- T&M: no CO for routine work within “Services Included”; CO only for commercial/legal controls (NTE, rates, authorization, Go-Live/payment prerequisites, material assumption shifts).
- Maintenance: included services → no new paper; excluded services → apply New SOW vs CO decision rule.

## CO drafting requirements (template-aligned)
Use: `docs/legal/contracts/Change Order Template.md`

Required outcomes:
- Reference documents (MSA date, original SOW number/date, project name).
- Section 1 Added/Removed/Modified scope must be specific.
- Impact tables must show **concrete deltas** (what changed vs original).
- Fees impact must match SOW model (fixed bid vs T&M).
- Assumptions/dependencies must be stated.

## Output location
- `docs/legal/drafts/change-orders/CO-####/CO-#### - Change Order - [short-title].md`

## Tracking table (required)
At top of the CO draft, include a Tracking table with:
- DocID (CO-####)
- Status: Draft
- Related IDs: controlling `SOW-####`
- Date
- Summary
- Source: `.cursor/plans/...`
