# Composable Rules

All Cursor rules must be composable—they should work together without conflicts.

## Requirements

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each rule addresses one specific concern or domain
2. **No Conflicts**: Rules must not contradict each other or create conflicting directives
3. **Clear Scope**: Use `globs` to limit rule application to relevant files when appropriate
4. **Modular Design**: Rules should be independent and combinable, not interdependent
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns and conventions across rules

## Before Creating a New Rule

- Check existing rules for overlap or conflicts
- Ensure the rule can coexist with all other active rules
- Use `alwaysApply: false` and `globs` to limit scope when possible
- Keep rules focused and avoid broad, catch-all directives

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Rules that override or contradict other rules
- ❌ Rules that require specific ordering or dependencies
- ❌ Rules that assume exclusive control over a domain
- ❌ Rules with overlapping responsibilities

## Behaviors

- Before finalizing any new rule: Verify it doesn't violate anti-patterns listed above
- When adding cross-references between rules: Stop—this creates a dependency
- When extracting shared content: Use `alwaysApply: true` instead of cross-references
